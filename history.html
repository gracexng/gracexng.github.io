        The unique culinary art of yum cha emerged in China thousands of years
        ago with some sources saying it came about 2,500 years ago as evidenced in the
        poetry and music of that time. Originally it was an exclusive luxury made
        for the Emperor and his family; it was also enjoyed by the wealthy, but
        became widespread after travelers along the Silk Road stopped at tea
        houses during their long journeys. It was here that people discovered how dirnking tea
        can help with digestion, so small dishes of food were offered with the tea. This
        began the long tradition of yum cha.

        From there, the cuisine has been developed and changed as restaurants soon
        competed with each other for business by offering yum cha in increasing
        varieties. Nowadays, yum cha is an integral part of Chinese culture. It has
        even gained popularity and great appreciation in many other Asian countries
        where they've adjusted the fillings, pastries, and shapes depending on their
        cultures, regions, and climates, but the practice remains relatively the same.
        It has been argued that the tastiest and best yum cha comes from Southern China,
        Canton and Hong Kong, where people divulge in this delicacy every day; it would
        almost be blasphemy if it wasn't a daily fare with friends or family.
